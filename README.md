# Hi, I'm Jonathan Zul Luna üëã

I'm a fourth-year Computer Science Honours student at the University of Prince Edward Island (UPEI). I enjoy building practical software that solves real-world problems, with a focus on applied machine learning and full-stack web development.

Beyond my coursework, I'm committed to environmental action. I co-founded the **UPEI Climate Action Association** to create hands-on opportunities for students and the community to engage with sustainability.

## Featured Projects

Here are a few things I've built:

#### üå¶Ô∏è Deep Learning Weather Forecast (Newest project, in progress)
A deep learning system built with PyTorch to forecast weather conditions using the massive ERA5 climate dataset. A key part of the project involved building an efficient data pipeline using `xarray` and `Dask` to handle and process the large-scale climate data for model training.

#### üî¨ Oyster MSX Detection Pipeline
A human-in-the-loop system to help pathologists diagnose MSX disease in oysters more efficiently. I built the complete end-to-end pipeline, which processes large histology images, segments oyster tissue, and runs a YOLO-based object detector to find infections. The core of the project was solving a difficult image segmentation challenge by developing a hybrid system that combines classical computer vision with the Segment Anything Model (SAM).

#### üå± UPEI Climate Action Association Website
The official website for the UPEI Climate Action Association, which I designed and built from scratch. It serves as our main hub for event information, community updates, and member sign-ups. The site is built with a modern, component-based architecture and is integrated with a headless CMS for easy content management by the whole team.

**Tech:** Next.js, React, Tailwind CSS, Sanity.io (CMS), Vercel
